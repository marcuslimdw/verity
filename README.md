`verity` is a simple Discord bot for managing Among Us games. I wrote it one morning, and it's roughly functional, but I do intend to go back to it sometime to add functionality.

This isn't really meant for public use, so documentation is fairly limited. It's quite a simple project, though, so my intent should be pretty clear (I hope?).
